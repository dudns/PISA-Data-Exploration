# PISA Data Exploration


This project is a part of [Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002). 



### Project Overview 


This project has two parts. In the first part, I used Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a PISA 2012 dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. In the second part, I produced a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that I discovered in dataset. 

### Getting Started 


You'll need to install :

* Python

* Pandas
* Numpy 

* Matplotlib

* Seaborn

* pisa2012.csv file used in this project is too big to upload.
