# PISA Data Exploration


This project is a part of [Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002). 



### Project Overview 


This project has two parts. In the first part, I used Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a PISA 2012 dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. In the second part, I produced a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that I discovered in dataset.
